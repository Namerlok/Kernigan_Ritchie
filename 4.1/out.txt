if you can keep your head when all about you
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
if you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
if you can dream-and not make dreams your master;
if you can think-and not make thoughts your aim,
if you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
if you can make one heap of all your winnings
if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
if all men count with you, but none too much;
if you can fill the unforgiving minute
